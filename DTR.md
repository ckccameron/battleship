Project: Battleship

Group Member Names: Cam & Dan

Goals and Expectations for the Project (What does each group member hope to get out of this project? What do we want to achieve as a team? How will we know that we're successful?): Getting to "Meets Expectations" in the Rubric (passing Iteration 3 is the main part).

Team strengths & collaboration styles (consider discussing your Pairin qualities here): Work in a pair, but also know how to work by yourself and bring what you learned back into the group.

How we can use our strengths to overcome obstacles: Work diligently on one particular part of the project. Not be afraid to let the other person know if you're getting stuck.

Schedule Expectations (When are we available to work together and individually? What constraints do we have? Make sure to discuss the remote questions above in regards to this section): Generally anytime, weekends included.

Communication Expectations (How and often will we communicate? How do we keep lines of communication open? How will we make decisions as a team? How will we communicate about our emotional and mental well-being with each other?): Daily standup 8/8:30 AM. Daily retro in the evening, on slack or Zoom. And also communicate whenever via messaging on slack. Set guidelines from the first paired coding session, and try to stick to them and be mindful of when a decision point has been reached to discuss with the other person. We'll communicate emotional/mental wellbeing by not being afraid to talk about that in the conversation.

Abilities & Growth Expectations (Technical strengths and areas for desired improvement):

Workload Expectations (What features do we each want to work on?):

Workflow Expectations (Git workflow/Tools/Code Review/Reviewing Pull Requests/Debugging and Problem-solving Techniques):

Expectations for giving and receiving feedback:
